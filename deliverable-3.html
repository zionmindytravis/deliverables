<!--Write a function that returns the SUM of a sequence of numbers. This sequence is determined by three variables: start, finish, and step. The sequence begins at start, ends at finish, and goes up by step until it reaches finish or a number that when increased by step would go past finish.

Example 1:
Input: start: 1 finish: 4 step: 1
Output: 10

Example 2:
Input: start: 4 finish: 10 step: 5
Output: 13

<script>

    function sum(start, finish, step) {
        let sum = 0;
        for (let i = start; i <= finish; i += step) {
            sum += i;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    console.log(sum(1, 4, 1));
    console.log(sum(4 , 10, 5));
